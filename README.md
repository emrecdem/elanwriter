A tool to write out Elan (.eaf) files using python.

Author: B.L. de Vries

UPDATE 6-5-2019: this tool is no longer developed or maintained by me. The state of the tool is still very experimental so users be warned.

## Introduction
This package allows to write out Elan (a video annotation tool, https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) files.


## Old installation instructions (might not work anymore):

1. Please follow the general guidelines for installing python packages and use a virtual environment:
	- Instructions for installing python packages with pip: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/
	- You can also consider using conda to manage your environments: https://conda.io/docs/

2. When you are in your command-line console and optionally, your virtual environment, install exploface by typing:
```
pip install elanwriter
```

3. Test the installation by starting the python shell (type ```python``` in your command-line). And then test by running
```
import elanwriter
```
